# COSC349
University of Otago COSC349 Cloud Architecture

## Windows Access
Due to a Vagrant issue, access on a windows machine required the open virtualbox manager application instance

## Project Description
This application aims to integrate the functionality of three seperate virtual machines in an expandable manner.
The program will provide a web interface, a backend database and an administrative user, each with a virtual machine hosting their respective functionality. The creation and integration of these machines is to represent the potential of virtualisation in portable software applications. 
This project will utilise Vagrant as an underlying technology to build and maintain these virtualised environments in a hypervisor-like manner.
